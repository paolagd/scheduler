# Interview Scheduler

## About 

Interview scheduler is an App that helps with the logistics of scheduling interviews. It provides information about your week, how many appointments have been scheduled, for what student and with what interviewer, and how many spots left there are for each day.

It is also responsive, so you can review your appointments on your phone, computer or tablet!

## How does it work?

You can add, cancel and edit interviews very easily.
